    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      I would not be where I am today without my long work history in the
      service industry and retail. Prior to entering the corporate workforce, I
      worked as a bartender which fulfilled my love for customer service and
      allowed me to meet people from all walks of life. I was first exposed to
      marketing when I took on the position of social media manager for
      Houndsooth Sports Bar, allowing me to explore a new interest and utilize
      the visual design and marketing skills that I learned in my academic
      program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the professional world, I enjoy spending time with my dog,
      Stitch, as well as dancing, skiing, and traveling. I love learning about
      other cultures and one day hope to experience as many as I can firsthand.
      The picture from below is from my 2021 trip to Hawaii, where I snorkeled,
      hiked, and explored native dishes and fruits!
